# GUI-Web-Scraping

Result from the final GUI/Web Scaping practical for GEOG5003M: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis.

Please open the Model_v0.1.py file and run in suitable environment (e.g. Spyder). Output should include: 1. A GUI with a drop down menu. Please select "Run Model", and an animated scatter plot of environment and agents, showing 100 agents per frame, for 10 frames will appear in the window.

The Environment should also export to a .csv when the model is executed.

An attempt has been made to import .html data (in Model.py). However, this was unsuccessful.

The model at various stages of development following previous practicals is available in the following GitHub repositories:
1. Agents! - https://github.com/leoleeds/Agents
2. I/O - https://github.com/leoleeds/I-O
3. Communicating - https://github.com/leoleeds/Communicating
4. Animation/Behaviour - https://github.com/leoleeds/Animation-Behaviour
